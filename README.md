# Traffic-pattern-analysis
Analysing the traffic pattern of Ads in apps
The purpose of this analysis is to understand traffic behavior patterns and identify why some 
traffic sources are flagged as Invalid Traffic (IVT) earlier, some later, while others remain non-IVT. 
The analysis was performed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning, 
visualization, and pattern detection.
